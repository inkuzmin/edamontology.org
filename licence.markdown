We recommend, however, that while EDAM is being actively maintained by its authors, substantial derived work, major modifications (especially conceptual and semantic), and re-definitions of concepts and other content (_e.g._ additional constraints on EDAM concepts/`owl:Class`-es within `owl:imports` meant with universal validity, that would "close" some desired options of the open-world assumption) are consulted with the EDAM core developers beforehand at the time of consideration, and consistent solutions are sought in collaboration.
