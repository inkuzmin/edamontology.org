EDAM is a comprehensive ontology of well-established, familiar concepts that are prevalent within bioinformatics and computational biology, including types of data and data identifiers, data formats, operations and topics. EDAM provides a set of concepts with preferred terms and synonyms, definitions, and some additional information - organised into a simple and intuitive hierarchy for convenient use.

EDAM is a community project and its development can be followed at [GitHub](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). Our core priority is to be responsive to end-users.  Please read the [documentation](http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
